This is a page with data analysis for a project memo in my Covering education class. All these datasets come directly from NYSED or NYC Open data. I'm interested in everything from shifting demographics to suspension rates to chronic absenteeism figures over time. You can see some of my exploratory analysis in my jupyter notebook (KGIA). As and when I have interesting findings that I am trying to report out, I will visualize trends and post the link to the webpage here in this readme file.
